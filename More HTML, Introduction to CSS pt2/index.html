He is often considered to be the greatest Power Ranger of all time, having been part of four Power Ranger teams over the years. Tommy's career as a Power Ranger did not start like most, as he was chosen by Rita Repulsa to become her evil Green Ranger, making him the first evil Ranger in Power Ranger history. He was tasked with destroying the original team of Power Rangers and had nearly succeeded, although he was ultimately defeated and was released from Rita's control by the original Red Ranger, Jason. Having turned good, Tommy helped the Rangers in defeating the forces of darkness and was made an official member of the team. In doing so, not only did Tommy prove himself to be a worthy ally, but he became exactly the kind of leader the Rangers needed and was therefore promoted, taking command from Jason. Tommy has gone through a number of power variations through the years. Originally the first Green Ranger of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Those powers ran dry and he became the White Ranger and the White Ninja Ranger of the same team, Zeo Ranger V Red of the Zeo Rangers, and the first Red Turbo Ranger of the Turbo Rangers.</p>
